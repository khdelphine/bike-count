# Summary

* Process the survey data for Bike Count. 
* Input: Single Excel file exported from Filemaker Pro database (987 rows and 47 columns). It is assumed that ONLY the rows for one single year are present
* Developed specifically for Bike Count 2019, but should work with any future Bike Count edition, possibly with a few minor adjustments.
* Output: Produces an Excel file where the data has been restructured and aggregated (XXX columns and XXX rows).

# 1. Init

## Initialize the paths and names. 

```{r init}
library(readxl) 
library(xlsx)

home <- "C:/Users/delph/Desktop/GIS/BCGP/Bike_count/BikeCount2019/"
inFolder <- "Raw/"
inTable <- "test5"
outFolder <- "Output/"

```


# 2. Read data and prepare it

## Read the raw Excel input spreadsheet 

```{r read_excel}

# Create the path
fileToRead <- paste(home, inFolder, inTable, ".xlsx", sep="")
fileToRead

# Read the file
bcDataOrig <- as.data.frame(read_excel(fileToRead))

# Create a copy of the dataframe to keep the original intact
bcData <- bcDataOrig
bcData

```


## Do some cleanup and remove superfluous columns

```{r cleanup}

# Clean up the names of the columns
names(bcData) = gsub(pattern = "IntersectionsPlusDirections::", 
                     replacement = "", x = names(bcData))
names(bcData) = gsub(pattern = "Derived ", 
                     replacement = "", x = names(bcData))
names(bcData) = gsub(pattern = "Count (.+)$", 
                     replacement = "\\1 Count", x = names(bcData))
names(bcData)[names(bcData)=="__CountOccurrencePK"] <- "Record ID"
names(bcData)[names(bcData)=="_IntersectionsFK"] <- "Inters And Direc ID"

# Add this new variable that we will populate later
bcData$"BPH per Intersection" = 0

# Reorder the columns and drop the ones we don't need
bcData2 <- bcData[c("Record ID",	"Inters And Direc ID", "Bridge vs Roads",	"Intersection",	"Street",	"Direction", "Date",	"Time",	"AM PM",	"Year",	"Facility for Street", "Total Count", "Bikes Per Hour Projected", "Num of Directions in Intersection",	"BPH per Intersection", "Male Count", "Female Count",  "With Traffic Male",	"With Traffic Female",	"Sidewalk Male", "Sidewalk Female", "Wrong Way Male",	"Wrong Way Female", 	"Helmet Male",	"Helmet Female",	"Bikes Share Users", 	"Bike Share Sidewalk Wrong Way",	"Bikes on Buses", "Pedestrians", "EScooters")]

# Replace NAs with 0
numOfCol <- ncol(bcData2)
bcData2[12:numOfCol][is.na(bcData2[12:numOfCol])] <- 0

bcData2

```

## Add intermediary columns

```{r add_intermediary_columns}

# Compute the Bicycle Per Hour equivalent per intersection for each row.
# This will be used to compute the total average per hour at every intersection
bcData2$"BPH per Intersection" <- bcData2$"Total Count" * bcData2$"Num of Directions in Intersection" * 4

# Add columns for totals across genders
bcData2$"With Traffic" = bcData2$"With Traffic Male" +	bcData2$"With Traffic Female"
bcData2$"Sidewalk" = bcData2$"Sidewalk Male" +	bcData2$"Sidewalk Female"
bcData2$"With Traffic" = bcData2$"With Traffic Male" +	bcData2$"With Traffic Female"
bcData2$"Wrong Way" = bcData2$"Wrong Way Male" +	bcData2$"Wrong Way Female"
bcData2$"Helmet" = bcData2$"Helmet Male" +	bcData2$"Helmet Female"

bcData2
```


## Make lists of names

```{r make_lists_of_names}

# Get the list of all bridge names
bridgeNames <- unique(bcData2[bcData2$"Bridge vs Roads" == "Bridge" ,]
                      $Intersection)

# Get the list of all bicycle facility names
streetNames <- unique(bcData2[bcData2$"Bridge vs Roads" == "Road" ,]
                            $Street)

# Get the list of all bicycle facility names
facilityNames <- unique(bcData2$"Facility for Street")
